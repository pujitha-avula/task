<h2><u> 1.What is a Programming language?? </u></h2>
<p><b>Ans</b>. A programming language is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a 
computer.<br>
 Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data 
analysis, and automation. <br>

<h2><u>2.Why Python??</u></h2>
<p><b>Ans</b>. Ease of Use: Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.<br> 
. Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, 
functional).<br> 
. Extensive Libraries: Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web 
development. <br>
. Community Support: Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.<br> 
. Interpreted Language: Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.<br> 
. Cross-Platform: Python programs can run on various platforms without modification<br>
(Windows, macOS, Linux). 
. Scalability: While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications 
when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools e.g.,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django">Django</a>" </p><hr>
<h2><u>3.What is Python</u></h2> 
<p><b>Ans</b>. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and 
readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991. 
Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
